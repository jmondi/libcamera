/**
 * \class FCQueue
 * \brief A support class for queueing Frame Context instances through the IPA
 * \tparam FrameContext The IPA specific Frame Context type for this queue
 *
 * The Frame Context Queue provides a simple circular buffer implementation to
 * store IPA specific context for each frame through its lifetime within the
 * IPA.
 *
 * FrameContexts are expected to be referenced by a monotonically increasing
 * sequence count referring to a Frame sequence.
 *
 * A FrameContext is initialised for a given frame when the corresponding
 * Request is first queued into the IPA. From that point on the FrameContext can
 * be obtained by the IPA and its algorithms by referencing it from the frame
 * sequence number.
 *
 * A frame sequence number from the image source must correspond to the request
 * sequence number for this implementation to be supported in an IPA. It is
 * expected that the same sequence number will be used to reference the context
 * of the Frame from the point of queueing the request, specifying controls for
 * a given frame, and processing of any ISP related controls and statistics for
 * the same corresponding image.
 *
 * IPA specific FrameContexts should inherit from the IPAFrameContext to support
 * the minimum required features for a FrameContext, including the frame number
 * and error flags that relate to the frame.
 *
 * FrameContexts are overwritten when they are recycled and re-initialised by
 * the first access made on them by either initialise(frame) or get(frame). If a
 * FrameContext is first accessed through get(frame) before calling initialise()
 * a PFCError is automatically raised on the FrameContext to be transferred to
 * the Request when it completes.

/**

 * \param[in] frame The frame context sequence number
 *
 * The first call to obtain a FrameContext from the FCQueue should be handled
 * through this call. The FrameContext will be initialised for the frame and
 * returned to the caller if it was not already initialised.
 *
 * If the FrameContext was already initialized for this sequence, a warning will
 * be reported and the previously initialized FrameContext is returned.

 * \return A reference to the FrameContext for sequence \a frame
